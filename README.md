![Landing Page](/public/css/images/landing.png)

The user will have an option to either login to an existing account or create a new account with specific attributes:
![Login](/public/css/images/login.png)

Each user, regardless of position, will then be directed to their profile page that includes personal information a long with tasks completed:
![Profile](/public/css/images/profile.png)

Now, depending on what position the user has, they will be redirected to specific dashboards. If they are a manager they will be able to create,update and see active tasks. If they are a supervisor they will only be able to update and look at the tasks they are in charge of. Finally, if they are a crew member they will only have the option to view their active tasks.

## Future Developments
Our commitment to excellence drives us to continuously enhance our web application, incorporating cutting-edge technology and innovative features. Our goal is to make task management effortless and efficient for employees and management alike. In line with this vision, we will be adding a direct message feature to our application. This new feature will allow users to communicate directly within the app itself, making task completion more seamless on top of having a more convenient method of contact. We understand that effective communication plays a crucial role in a successful completion. Another future plan would be an automated email service which emails managers the weekly tasks to be distributed amongst the employees.
